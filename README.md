3. In the "Appearance" menu, click on "Themes".
4. On the "Themes" page, click on the "Install Themes" tab.
5. Click on the "Upload" link at the top of the page.
6. On the "Upload" page, locate the theme / child theme archive (zip) on your computer and click "Install Now".

### Using FTP

1. Download the [Lean Child Theme Kit](https://github.com/jbrad/lean-child-theme-kit/zipball/master).
2. Unzip the ```lean-child-theme-kit.zip``` archive on your computer.
3. Connect to your server via FTP.

## Usage

Find the ```style.css``` file for the Lean Child Theme Kit and locate the "Customizations" section. You can add your own styles under this section to override the styles that come with Lean.

If you happened to name Lean 3 theme directory anything else besides "lean" when you installed the theme, you will need to update the "Template" name and the ```@import``` path in the Lean Child Theme Kit's ```style.css``` in order for it to work correctly.
